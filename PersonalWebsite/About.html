        <p>
            My name is Kyle Brandon, and I am from New Orleans. I am graduating from the University of Oklahoma with a bachelor’s in management information systems. My hobbies include camping, hiking, and finding hole in the wall places to eat. My favorite spot to go to is camping in the Arkansas Ozarks. I have played soccer my whole life and I am a diehard Manchester United fan. My work experience ranges from Customer Service to Research and Data Collection.

            <h5>Student Research Assistant</h5>
            <p>
                As a Student Research Assistant, I would assist research professors and grad students on their projects and surveys. Our main projects would be finding public opinion on specific topics. These topics range from nuclear energy, weather, power grid, and COVID-19. We would receive a full data hose of twitter tweets and filter out keywords and then individually code the filter words if it matches a certain category after weeks of research. After our team finished our coding assignments, we would have meetings with the research professors or professionals, and I would present our findings for education, publishment, or for funding.
